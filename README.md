# Recipe App - IOS
## Learning Objectives

- `Arrays` for storing collection of data
- Swifft lists using the `List` element view
- `Navigation View` enables to navigate to new screen, `Navigation Link` actually navigates you to specified view, 
be sure to use `Navigation Link` inside `Navigation View`
- `Loops` to iterate over an array of items fro index purposes, if you care about the index position instead of data 
- `Classes` and how they differ from structs
- `Value` vs `Reference types`, classes share instances (RT) and structs make copies of instances (VT)
- `MVVM` pattern and how to structure your project (Model, View, ViewModel) -> Models describe a data structure, 
Views(UI) renders data, ViewModel handles business logic and state of app.
- `Optionals`, meaning that variable might have data, it might not (check this!)
- `Dictionaries` are another collection data type to use, you can combine them with arrays -> 

```json
  {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "age": 25
  }
```
- `Parsing JSON` locally from a file
- `ForEach` for looping throguh data and output custom UI, diff from using `List` element
- `EnvironmentObject` is a way to share data across multiple views
- `Geometery reader` gives access to the sizing and postioning of the device. This would help to position views
in certain places.
